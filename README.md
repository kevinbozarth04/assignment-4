# NPC AND UNIQUE AI

Thief enemy: Smart and sneaky. They will hide behind trees and wait for the player to get close enough before leaping out with a burst of speed and chasing down the player. If the player gets too far, it smartly returns to it's hiding spot behind the tree.

Evil Pig enemy: Not very smart or fast, but it can smell the player and know their location at all times. It travels from its home cobweb in a straight line towards the player until it is killed.

Pig: This NPC just wants to survive. It will run away from the player if the player gets too close. If it is chased into the edge of the map, it will disappear into the bushes and emerge elsewhere on the map.

# LEVEL KEVIN

This map has a layout that gives the thief enemies a nice environment to use to their advantage against the player. The trees and giant mushrooms can be used by the thieves as cover to ambush the player when they're least expecting it.

This level features thieves, pigs, and evil pigs.

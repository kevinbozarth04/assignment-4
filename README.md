# NPC AND UNIQUE AI

## Kevin's AI

Thief enemy: Smart and sneaky. They will hide behind trees and wait for the player to get close enough before leaping out with a burst of speed and chasing down the player. If the player gets too far, it smartly returns to it's hiding spot behind the tree.

Evil Pig enemy: Not very smart or fast, but it can smell the player and know their location at all times. It travels from its home cobweb in a straight line towards the player until it is killed.

Pig: This NPC just wants to survive. It will run away from the player if the player gets too close. If it is chased into the edge of the map, it will disappear into the bushes and emerge elsewhere on the map.

## Sam's AI

Gnome enemy: These enemies will get scared and start scattering about when the player gets close to them. Once the player collects their treasured inngredient, however, they will chase the player down in anger. If the player gets too far away from the gnomes while they are scattering, they will stop and return home. Same thing happens if they are chasing the player and they get too far.

Crab enemy: These enemies will jump out of the pond once the player collects some of their home. These crabs have magic, and can teleport around the player at random intervals, making it to wehre if the player decides to run away from the crabs, they can appear on the other side of the player.

Frog enemy: These enemies will chase the player, and at a specific interval, will stop and shoot acid spit at the player. If the player gets too far away from the frogs, they will return to their poison swamp.

# LEVEL KEVIN

This map has a layout that gives the thief enemies a nice environment to use to their advantage against the player. The trees and giant mushrooms can be used by the thieves as cover to ambush the player when they're least expecting it.

# LEVEL SAM

This map has different biomes around the map, and each biome houses a different enemy type. To the bottom left, we have the gnome forest, where the forest gnomes live with their flour. To the middle right, we have the pond, which houses the crab enemies that jump the player if they take from their home. To the top right, we have the poison swamp with the frogs that protect their main food source, green onions. The maze in the middle was created to corner the player off if they tried to grab ingredients with enemies chasing them. The top left is the mud pools, which have the pig NPC from Kevin's level as an easter egg.

# Rubric and Self Evaluation

## Slight change to rubric

We changed the enemy AI portion of the rubric. It is now worth three points instead of four, and these three points are the individual points of the self evaluation. We also added an extra category that has to do with the player and obstacle collisions worth one point. We will include our Design Document with the updated rubric in the zip of our project. It is a PDF, so it would need to be viewed outside of VS code or whatever you're using. The reason we opted to change the point count is because the AI used in our levels are made completely seperate from each other. The reason we added the extra point category is so that the total points for the rubric is still 10, as well as including a mechanic that is used throughout both levels.
